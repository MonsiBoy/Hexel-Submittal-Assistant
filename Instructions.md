## Bookmark Tab
This tab allows the user to automate the creation of tabs based on the configured page title that the user will be required to set on the upper portion of the pages that a bookmark is required. 
After scanning the user may edit, arrange, add, and delete bookmarks at the bookmar tree. The complete process is listed below:

1. Place page titles on the upper portion of pages a bookmark is required. It is paramount that these titles are written in RED fonts, the bounding box may be in any desired color. A sample image is shown below:

  </p>

2. Upload the PDF file by dragging or clicking the browse button.

 </p>   
   
4. After uploading, 3 modes for scanning the PDF will be available;
   - **Read Only** this mode will only read existing bookmarks of the PDF File.
   - **Scan Only** this mode will scan the entire the PDF for the RED title pages.
   - **Scan and Read** this mode is a combination of the two previous modes.
   After selecting and uploading a file, the scan button should light up.

  </p>   
      
5. After pressing scan, the desired output should now appear at the bookmark tree. Here bookmarks can renamed, deleted, and arranged (Parent, Child heirarchy included).
   Each bookmark's target page can also be edited by right clicking the desired bookmark and clicking "Edit Bookmark".

 </p>   

 A pop-up should appear like the one below should appear:

 </p>   

 Do take note added blank bookmarks will have a deafult page of "999999" leave this as is or set it a page greater than your PDF's total number of pages to ensure it won't link erroneously to a page.

 6. After editing, the save destination should be selected to ensure that the file saves at the desired location by default the file name will be "<Filname>_with Bookmarks.pdf"
 
 7. Press Confirm and the bookmarked PDF should appear in the chosed save destination.

Note: In the event, the confirm button is pressed again it will overwrite the existing file. This can be useful when a after the fact editing. Just make sure the file is not open, when doing so to avoid overwriting errors.
