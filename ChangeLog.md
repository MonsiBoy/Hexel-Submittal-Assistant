## v0.001
-


## v0.0012
- Added bookmark making funcionality
- removed non-functioning buttons in the file bar
- Default window size adjusted to fit all widgets

- ## v0.002 (MAJOR UPDATE)
Entire program was ported to an entire library (Pyside6) due to limitations of the aging Tktinter. The UI will feel much more cleaner and modern, overall it will feel less clunky. With that being said the entire title maker functionality has been temporarily removed from this version as I feel it could be implemented better than the way I did in the previous versions. I've listed the features of this version below:
### Bookmark tab
  - A more expansive hierarchical tree has been added, took inspiration from PDFXchange's implementation of the "Bookmark Tree". It will now be much easier to manage nested bookmarks in this version
  - Additional modes have been added depending on your need, existing bookmarks can now be read.
### New Tool Tab
This is a new tab filled with "good to have" tools that may or MAY NOT quicken your work, I plan to add more tools as I discover more tedious repetive tasks. If you have any suggestions please don't hesistate to contact me! For now the tab has 3 tools you can freely use
  - QR Scanner, this is a simple but God sent tool. Its surprisingly hard to find an online QR scanner (Trust me I tried)
  - Text Scanner, have you ever had a pdf where you can't for the love of god select the text? I know I have, so I added this nifty tool that reads the texts in your screen and yep you can now copy and paste those cursed uncopyable texts. The current scanner only has one OCR model available, EasyOCR, for all intents and purposes its enough but, I am currently trying to add a more robust OCR model the PaddleOCR it built to read texts and even tables. But the whole documentation is in Chinese so it may take me a while to learn the ropes but do look forward for it!
  - Auto Directory Tree builder, this would just basically allow you to automatically create a directory. I took the liberty and created two templates you can use. If you tend to use a different template than the one I created tell me! I'll create it for you and bake it into the program for next time! Also, you can choose to include a few Industry Standard references, in by no means is this library extensive but I will slowly build it as I get my hands on them. Do note that these files are not meant for "group use" so take every necessary precaution you need.

The program is far from finished so I hope for you kind patience, I only build the program during my free time. If you have any I mean any feature you want to add don't hesitate to reach out. I'll be posting a development roadmap anytime next month so you'd be able to check whats coming up!
