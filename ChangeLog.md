## v0.001
-


## v0.0012
- Added bookmark making funcionality
- removed non-functioning buttons in the file bar
- Default window size adjusted to fit all widgets

- ## v0.002 (MAJOR UPDATE)
- Entire program was ported to an entire library (Pyside6) due to limitations of the aging Tktinter. The UI will feel much more cleaner and modern, overall it will feel less clunky. With that being said the entire title maker functionality has been temporarily removed from this version as I feel it could be implemented better than the way I did in the previous versions. I've listed the features of this version below:
# Bookmark tab
  - A more expansive hierarchical tree has been added, took inspiration from PDFXchange's implementation of the "Bookmark Tree". It will now be much easier to manage nested bookmarks in this version
  - Additional modes of been added depending on your need, existing bookmarks can now be read.
